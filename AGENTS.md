<!-- bram:start -->
This repo is driven through Bram. The canonical worklist gate is carried by codex's `developer_instructions` (top-level in `~/.codex/config.toml`, installed by Bram Setup) and enforced at runtime by a single `PreToolUse` hook installed under `~/.bram`; explicit same-turn opt-out phrases such as "just do it" are recorded host-side when Bram sends the turn. Read `app/__shell/conventions.md` for the full conventions, including opt-out phrases, the two-stage proposed → applied → committed flow, approval payload shape, loopback lifecycle calls, and edge cases.

Quick summary so you can act in this turn:

- First response to a change request must be **(a)** a clarifying question, **(b)** a proposal — write the prose to `resources/worklist-drafts/<id>.md` (sections `# Before` and `# After`), then add a metadata-only item to `resources/worklist.json` with non-empty `id` and `file`/`files` (no `before` / `after` inline — the guard rejects them), or **(c)** read-only investigation explicitly prefaced *"I don't yet have enough context to propose; I need to check X first"* — and the very next action after that check must be the proposal write, not narration of a plan.
- For XMLUI questions or non-obvious markup choices, ask the XMLUI MCP server for how-to documents first (`xmlui_search_howto`) before examples or component docs; `app/__shell/conventions.md` has the full lookup-order rule.
- Mutations (`apply_patch`, `Bash`, `mcp__filesystem__write/edit/create/move`, etc.) on paths not covered by a proposed/applied worklist item are blocked at runtime. Following the convention avoids hitting that wall.
- Approval comes from the Worklist tab's **Approve** button (and **Drop** / **Iterate** for those flows) — the button generates a hash-verified `approved: {"items":[...]}` / `drop: {...}` / `iterate: {...}` payload via `toTurn`. Treat that payload as the *wire format the host parses*, not as something the user types. When the user asks "how do I approve?" answer **"Click the Approve button in the Worklist tab"** (Drop, Iterate). Never instruct the user to type or paste `approved:` / `drop:` / `iterate:` payloads. Don't infer authorization from free-text replies; wait for the structured form the buttons emit.
- For Bram lifecycle calls use the **filesystem channel**, not loopback curl — Codex's sandbox refuses loopback connections (#130). Write `resources/.worklist-intent.json` as `{"nonce":"<unique>","route":"<r>","body":{...}}` where `<r>` is `worklist-resolve` or `worklist-mutate`; then read `resources/.worklist-result.json` and act on the entry whose `nonce` matches yours. Do **not** continue silently if the result is missing or `ok` is `false`. Full lifecycle is canonical in `app/__shell/conventions.md`.
- For `approved:` and `drop:` turns, always send `worklist-resolve` before `worklist-mutate`. Resolve delivers the hash-verified item bodies, consumes auth, and writes the inflight sentinel the Worklist spinner depends on. Reading `.worklist-authorization.json` directly and jumping straight to mutate skips that write and orphans the spinner until a tab switch (#133).
- For `iterate:` turns, do **not** call `worklist-resolve` or `worklist-mutate`; iterate is not an authorization to change lifecycle state. **No lifecycle bracket needed** — the host detects the `iterate:` prefix on the `toTurn` write path and sets the inflight sentinel automatically; the same turn-finished detectors that clear approve/drop sentinels clear iterate's too. Legacy `iterate-begin` and `iterate-end` routes still work for back-compat but are no longer required. Read any `feedbackRef` draft from `resources/feedback-drafts/`, and revise the proposed draft or applied files according to `app/__shell/conventions.md`.
- For `skip-worklist:` turns (your incoming turn begins literally with `skip-worklist: ` followed by the request), the user has authorized a direct edit for this turn. The host has already written a fresh `direct-edit` record to `resources/.worklist-authorization.json` covering all paths. Do **not** propose, do **not** write a worklist item — act on the rest of the message as a direct edit, the PreToolUse hook will allow it via the existing `fresh_bypass()` path. Same wire-format family as `approved:` / `drop:` / `iterate:`, but for one-turn direct-edit authorization.
- `resources/worklist.json` carries a top-level `version: N` integer. Any write you make (apply_patch or mcp__filesystem write) must set `version: N+1` where `N` is what was on disk when you read the file. The PreToolUse hook denies stale writes with `reason=stale-worklist-version`; re-read, rebase, retry. `/__worklist/mutate` bumps the version on its own RMW path. Missing version field = treat as 0 (legacy migration path).

### Cross-surface collaboration (Planner / Coder)

This repo is developed across two Claude surfaces that share only the git remote.

- **Planner** (Claude Code in Obsidian, vault context): scope + architecture
  calls, design-doc drafts, review of diffs against intent the repo can't see.
  Writes GitHub Issues and vault drafts; does **not** write repo code except in
  announced, synced handoffs.
- **Coder** (this Bram project): the single primary writer to the working tree.
  Implements issues and commits/pushes via the worklist flow.
- **Membrane = git + GitHub Issues.** Nothing else is shared.
- **Sync before write.** Any agent pulls / re-reads the actual repo state before
  writing or proposing — never act on cached context.
- **Planner → Coder channel = GitHub Issues.** Larger specs arrive as design
  docs the Planner drafts and the Coder commits.
